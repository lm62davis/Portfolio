      <td height="500" valign="top"><p>Franklin Castle was built in 1864 for German immigrant Hannes Tiedemann (1833-1908), who originally prospered from his barrel-making business, later the banking industry, and finally as founder of the Euclid Avenue Savings and Trust. The house was built in the mid-1800's to celebrate and glorify his success. It was designed by Cudell and Richardson, one of the most prestigious architectural firm in Cleveland in the late 19th century. It was -- and still is -- one of the most architecturally distinguished houses in Cleveland. Cudell and Richardson were primarily commercial architects, responsible for the most progressive commercial buildings and churches in the area. Very few residences have been attributed to their firm.</p>
        <p>When the Castle was built it was one of the first on Franklin Avenue, which grew to host dozens of mansions during Cleveland's industrial boom. Tiedemann spared no expense in making his Victorian home the showpiece of the city. The turreted, four-story mansion boasts around thirty rooms, including a large ballroom on the fourth floor accessible by its own staircase, plus a large carriage house. It features carved stonework on the exterior, elaborate, marble fireplaces throughout, dumb-waiters, wine cellars, and numerous hidden passageways. The property overlooks both downtown and Lake Erie.</p>
        <p>Tiedemann's mansion was home to his wife, Luise, his mother, Wiebeka, and several children, plus servants, who were quartered on the first floor. The family lived there for thirty-three years.</p>
        <p>The Tiedemann family had its first tragedy in 1881 when Wiebeka and the Tiedemanns' fifteen year-old daughter, Emma, died within weeks of one another. (Emma's official cause of death was listed as diabetes.)</p>
        <p>To take his wife's mind off the family tragedies, Tiedemann enlisted the services of a prominent architectural firm to design some additions to the mansion. It was during this expansion that the secret passages, concealed rooms and hidden doors were added to the house.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the children of the family met an untimely end. Not long after the deaths of her children, Luise died as well. Her funeral was held in the front parlor.</p>
        <p>Around 1900 Hannes sold the Castle to a brewer named Mullhauser and moved to Lake Road. Ironically, he outlived his entire family and in 1908 died "suddenly while walking in the park". The Tiedemanns are buried in Riverside Cemetery.</p></td>
      <td valign="top"><p>Tiedemann's Castle has a long history of psychic disturbances: doors explode off their hinges, chandeliers spin around, mirrors fog
	  	  up for no reason, and lights turn themselves on and off. The unexplainable crying of babies is heard, a ghostly cloud moves through the upstairs hall, and the 
		  apparition of a woman in black has been seen several times staring out a tiny window in the front tower room.</p>
        <p>The manifestations are thought to be connected with Hannes Tiedemann, who built the great house in 1864. The majority of the myths and legends about the Castle stem from this tenancy. Whether it is a fair description or not, history has painted Hannes Tiedemann as overbearing and dominating, at best. At worst, as a cruel and tempermental monster of a man, capable of the worst crimes of passion. For generations, a number of murders have been attributed to him, though he was never formally accused, let alone tried or convicted. Nonetheless, it is considered to be a fact that he was responsible for the deaths of at least two women in his household: a young girl and a servant.</p>
        <p>The accounts of the murders vary, of course. According to some, it was Emma who was found hanging from the rafters. Another story has the dead girl being Tiedemann's 13-year-old niece who he supposedly found trying to seduce his grandchildren and, in a fit of rage, hanged her. Yet others make her Karen, Hannes' illegitimate daughter by one of his servants.</p>
        <p>The other stories center around a servant girl that was murdered on her wedding day in a fit of jealousy, either hacked to death with an axe in a front turret window (with the neighbors hearing each whack). Or perhaps she was strangled in her bed when Hannes bound and gagged her upon learning of her engagement to another man and her intentions of leaving him. Some speculate that you can still hear choking sounds in the room where she was killed.</p>
        <p>Its been said a pile of small skeletons were found in a small room at the rear of the house. There origin are unknown. Some say they were the Tiedemann infants while others believe they were Hannes illegitimate babies, birthed by the servant girls. Speculation justifies why crying can be heard through the walls and explaining why young ghosts here are numerous.</p>
        <p> There were many rumors at the time that a family curse was taking its victims, one by one. The reasons given for the existence of such a curse ran from the house being built upon sacred ground to the whispers of the hanged girl in one of the secret closets off the majestic ballroom. No one was sure what was the cause of the curse, but they all believed it to be true.</p>
