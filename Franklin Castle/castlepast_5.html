      <td valign="top"><p>In 1994 Michelle Hiemburger, who had sworn at age 5 that she would someday live in the Castle, purchased it. She was intent on restoring the structure to a Victorian style and converting it into a bed-and-breakfast. The ghosts were supposed to help business. Two years later the house is nearly gutted in a fire. </p>
        <p>The arsonist is convicted and sentenced; the case is closed. Having gone through much of her finances trying to renovate the home, and keeping the city from demolishing it, Michelle sells to Charles Milsaps, a Cleveland area real estate developer.</p></td>
      <td valign="top"><p>On May 30th 1999, Heimburger held a "Castle Warming Party" under the full moon for friends and family to check out the progress of her new home. A grunge band played throughout the evening in the fourth floor ballroom, while hundreds of candles illuminated the rest of the interior of the house for the several hundred guests who attended. No ghosts were spotted. Revelers travelled through secret passageways to enjoy a view of the sunset from the castle's roof, turrets and balconies.</p>
        <p>However at 3:00am the preceding night, an overnight guest fled in terror when he began hearing the sound of a baby crying in his room.</p>
        <p> A photographer for a west coast paper, who covered the event, carefully checked all the negatives but no ghosts appeared. However, he did report his camera acted unexplainably 'odd' throughout the evening.</p></td>

      <td valign="top"><p>Charles Milsaps plans to restore the Castle into an "urban country club" with about 500 members, renaming it the Franklin Castle Club. He also plans to offer ghost hunters a chance to spend the night in this legendary haunted house, in the new bed and breakfast facilities. The Gothic mansion is set to re-open by mid 2004. </p></td>
      <td valign="top"><p><em>Other Ghost Stories:</em><br>
Many people have reported seeing a woman in black in an upstairs turret room, just staring out the window. Others report lights turning on and off, chandeliers that spin, doors that open and close, mirrors fog, doorbells ring. Mysterious sounds come from the walls--everything from muttering voices to babies crying. Visitors report feeling possessed or overtaken with another personality. There are cold spots, and times when whole rooms turn spontaneously icy. Many people have felt similar strange feelings in a certain area, without knowing where this particular 'spooky spot' is. Maybe someday we'll find out if something dramatic happened there....</p></td>
