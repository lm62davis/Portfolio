Please note: Most of what is listed under 'History' might as well be considered 
mythology.  Very little has been taken from official sources, and much is from

      <td height="500" valign="top"><p>The Sixties found the mansion being rented out as an apartment building and eventually left unoccupied until 1968 when the German Socialists sold it to James Romano, his wife, and five children. &nbsp; Their idea was to open a restaurant.</p>
        <p> Eventually, the family was forced into selling the house in 1974.</p></td>
      <td valign="top"><p>When the Romanos moved in, things got weird right away. Stories say that on the first day the family moved in, several of the children went to play on the fourth floor. They returned a while later and told their mother of their new playmate, a little girl who dressed and talked strangely, and who refused to leave the upstairs. They continued to play with the girl for quite a while, but could never get her to come downstairs.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Romano was apparently developing quite a bond with the deceased Mrs. Tiedemann. Both women had five children, including twin boys and both slept in the same room. Perhaps Luise Tiedemann chose Mrs. Romano to be the protector of the house. Immediately Mrs. Romano felt possessed by the house; she began to exhibit signs of mental illness as she claimed that she had "sort of made a pact with what is here in this house." She felt that Luise was using her to keep the house's secrets. And said the spirits were friendly, protective of her and the children, and that she had made a promise to protect the Castle.</p>
        <p>A variety of investigators visited the house during the Romanos' stay. A team of researchers from the Northeast Ohio Psychical Research Society visited and, in the middle of the investigations, one member of the team fled and vowed to never return. A writer saw a strange ectoplasmic cloud and felt dizzy to the point of passing out when she approached it. A Catholic priest refused to perform an exorcism, telling the family that he sensed an evil presence, and that the spirits were not to be trusted--that they were only being friendly to Mrs. Romano until they had her in their grasp. He advised them that they should move out immediately.  
  
      <p>The family moved out after Mrs. Romano's ghostly friend warned her of an impending death in the family... but unfortunately, the move did not prevent it.</p></td>
