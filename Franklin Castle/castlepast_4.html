mythology.  Very little has been taken from official sources, and much is from

      <td height="100" valign="top"><p>After the Romanos moved out in 1974, the house was purchased by Sam Muscatello, who originally thought about turning the building into a church. Later he gave tours of the house and built up the mythology of the hauntings, in an attempt to make it into a tourist attraction.</p></td>
      <td valign="top"><p>Sam Muscatello, was very enthusiatic about owning a haunted house. He started selling guided tours of the Castle, inviting visitors to share their haunting experiences. He also invited local media. One story involves John Webster, who was doing an on-air radio special about the house, and had a tape recorder ripped from his shoulder and flung down the stairs. Ted Ocepec,a television reporter at that time also reported seeing spinning chandeliers and feeling a general sense that the supernatural was at work.</p>
        <p>It was Muscatello who discovered some of the secret rooms (with the hidden stills from Prohibition) and the gruesome discovery of human bones in the walls. After which he started becoming sick and lost over thirty pounds in a matter of weeks. Of course, some speculate that he should not have been too upset about the bones... considering he placed them there, in a stunt to attract attention. Others think they were all of the butchered babies. Many believe they might have been more of Tiedemann's victims, or perhaps more Tiedemann children who had died in infancy.</p></td>

Impulsively he bought it the same day, despite the crumbling plaster, and nearly everything--including sinks, bathtubs, and all but five fireplaces-- had been stripped away. After a decade and over $1.3 million in his quest to turn back the clock and restore the structure to its former likeness, he is forced to sell due to financial difficulties.</p></td>
      <td valign="top"><p>DeVinko continuously found himself the center of coincidences as various parts of the house, from the original blueprints, to its first front door keys, to furniture used by the Tiedemann family, continued to simply show up at local antique dealerships. </p></td>
