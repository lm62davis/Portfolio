mythology.  Very little has been taken from official sources, and much is from

      <td height="500" valign="top"><p>There is little record of the Mullhausers' residency except that they sold the house to a German Singing Club in 1913 who owned it over the next fifty-five years. (Rumors say it was actually the German Socialist Party.) </p>
        <p>During the 1920s, the house is said to have been used by gangsters to brew alcohol during Prohibition. Its secret passages and rooms gave the gang plenty of places to build stills and while others were used as a speakeasy. </p>
        <p>By the 1930s, the house became the local National Socialists Headquarters.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the 50s, the house became a medical practice. The events of the period were rather uneventful.</p></td>
      <td valign="top"><p>While the American Nazi Party used the house to further their own ideology, they didn't take into account the divisions within their party. Within a few years, a political argument got out of hand and 20 Nazi sympathizers were killed by machine gun. &nbsp;(No newspaper accounts about this mass murder have been found.)</p>
        <p>Legend says that while the police were investigating the crime, they stumbled upon a secret room containing a short-wave radio and tons of Nazi propaganda flyers ready for distribution. Some say the German Socialists were spying from the house during the war.</p>
        <p>A Cleveland nurse recalled several years ago that she had cared for an ailing attorney in the castle in the early 1930's. She remembered being terrified at night by the sound of a small child crying. More than forty years later, she told a reporter that she "would never set foot in that house again."</p>
        <p>Soon after the doctor left, though, another secret room was opened to discover hundreds of bones of babies. Some speculated that the doctor had been performing illegal abortions upon the premises. But when the Coroner examined the bones he is said to have found that the bones were ancient and predated the house itself.</p>
        <p>At some point during this era, it is said that a horrible ax murder took place in the front tower. It is also said that sometimes, one can see the phantom figure of a woman in black, presumably the victim of the incident, looking out from the tower.</p></td>
